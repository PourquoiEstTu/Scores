# Scores
This is a program which will take the scores of two sports teams in different games laid out side-by-side in a csv file, calculate which score is higher,
and output it. It can do this for multiple pairs of teams and will also calculate the average score of the highest teams and output that as well.
The exact format can be found in the scores.csv file in "Scores\Alternate Assignment - Scores\bin\Debug" path.
